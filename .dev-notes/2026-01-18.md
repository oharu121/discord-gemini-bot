# 2026-01-18 - Fixing DNS Resolution on HF Spaces (Gradio SDK)

## Problem

After deploying to Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio SDK, the Discord bot failed to connect. The logs showed:

```
logging in using static token
```

But never progressed to "Logged in as..." - the connection hung indefinitely.

## Investigation

### Initial Diagnosis

Added detailed logging to `app.py` to surface the actual error:

```python
logger.info("Attempting login...")
await bot.login(token)
logger.info("Login successful, connecting to gateway...")
await bot.connect()
```

This revealed the real error:

```
ClientConnectorDNSError: Cannot connect to host discord.com:443 ssl:default [No address associated with hostname]
```

### Root Cause

**HF Spaces blocks DNS resolution for external hosts** like `discord.com`. This affects both Docker SDK and Gradio SDK, contrary to earlier assumptions that Gradio SDK had fewer restrictions.

The difference:
- **Docker SDK**: Crashed immediately with DNS error
- **Gradio SDK**: App started but Discord connection silently hung (until we added proper error logging)

## Solution: Custom DNS Resolver

Bypass HF Spaces' restricted DNS by using Google (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) DNS servers directly via aiohttp's `AsyncResolver`.

### Implementation

#### 1. Add `aiodns` dependency

**requirements.txt:**
```
aiodns>=3.0.0
```

**pyproject.toml:**
```toml
dependencies = [
    "aiodns>=3.0.0",
    # ... other deps
]
```

#### 2. Create async connector factory

**src/bot/client.py:**
```python
async def create_connector_with_custom_dns() -> aiohttp.TCPConnector:
    """Create aiohttp connector with custom DNS resolver (Google/Cloudflare).

    Must be called from within an async context (running event loop).
    """
    try:
        from aiohttp.resolver import AsyncResolver
        resolver = AsyncResolver(nameservers=["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"])
        logger.info("Using custom DNS resolver (Google/Cloudflare)")
        return aiohttp.TCPConnector(resolver=resolver)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to create custom DNS resolver: {e}, using default")
        return aiohttp.TCPConnector()
```

#### 3. Update DiscordBot to accept connector

**src/bot/client.py:**
```python
class DiscordBot(discord.Client):
    def __init__(self, connector: aiohttp.TCPConnector | None = None):
        intents = discord.Intents.all()
        super().__init__(intents=intents, connector=connector)
```

#### 4. Create connector inside async context

**app.py:**
```python
def start_discord_bot() -> None:
    import asyncio
    from src.utils.logging import logger

    async def runner() -> None:
        from src import config
        from src.bot.client import DiscordBot, create_connector_with_custom_dns

        # ... validation ...

        # CRITICAL: Must be created inside async context (running event loop)
        connector = await create_connector_with_custom_dns()
        bot = DiscordBot(connector=connector)

        # ... login and connect ...

    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(runner())
```

### Key Insight: Event Loop Timing

The `AsyncResolver` requires a **running** event loop. Several attempts failed:

1. **Creating connector before event loop** - Failed: "no running event loop"
2. **Creating connector after `asyncio.set_event_loop()`** - Failed: loop exists but isn't "running"
3. **Creating connector inside `async def runner()`** - Success: loop is running during `run_until_complete()`

## Successful Deployment Logs

## Summary

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| DNS blocked | `ClientConnectorDNSError: No address associated with hostname` | Use `AsyncResolver` with Google/Cloudflare DNS |
| No running event loop | `RuntimeError: no running event loop` | Create connector inside `async def` function called via `run_until_complete()` |
| Silent failures | Bot hangs with no error | Add explicit logging around `login()` and `connect()` |

## Files Changed

- `app.py` - Restructured to create connector inside async context
- `src/bot/client.py` - Added `create_connector_with_custom_dns()`, updated `DiscordBot.__init__` to accept connector
- `requirements.txt` - Added `aiodns>=3.0.0`
- `pyproject.toml` - Added `aiodns>=3.0.0`

## Docker SDK Migration

After solving the DNS issue, we migrated from Gradio SDK to Docker SDK.

### Why Migrate?

With the custom DNS resolver working at the application level, there's no longer any advantage to using Gradio SDK. Docker SDK allows us to:

1. Use `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth for dependencies
2. Remove the `requirements.txt` maintenance burden
3. Use `uv` for faster dependency installs in production

### Health Check Timeout Issue

After migrating to Docker SDK, the deployment failed with:

```
Launch timed out, workload was not healthy after 30 min
```

The bot logged in successfully:
```
Login successful, connecting to gateway...
Logged in as oharu-chatbot#0099
```

But Gradio was binding to localhost only:
```
* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Root Cause

Gradio's `demo.launch()` defaults to `server_name="127.0.0.1"` (localhost). In Docker containers, HF Spaces health check comes from outside the container and cannot reach localhost.

### Fix

Update `app.py` to bind to all network interfaces:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # server_name="0.0.0.0" binds to all interfaces (required for Docker/HF Spaces)
    demo.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", server_port=7860)
```

### Migration Summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Changed `sdk: gradio` → `sdk: docker`, removed `sdk_version` |
| `Dockerfile` | Updated to run `app.py` with `uv run`, expose port 7860 |
| `requirements.txt` | Deleted |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Removed `requirements.txt` from paths trigger |
| `app.py` | Added `server_name="0.0.0.0"` to `demo.launch()` |
